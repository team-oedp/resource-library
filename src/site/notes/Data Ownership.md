What is it?

Data ownership is the control of and responsibility for the data. This means defining who has a right to manage data, including who can access, modify, analyze, and share data. Data ownership is complex and difficult to define because there is a lack of standardization and common practices surrounding ownership. In different scenarios, different actors can claim ownership over data. Some examples include:

- Subject: If personal data is collected, the subject of that data will own the data. This is important in environmental data because it enables subjects to use their data for climate action in their communities.
    
- Creator: The party that creates or generates the data can also claim ownership over environmental data. This could be the organization itself or the people within the organization that collected the data. This is important for determining how the data will be used and shared by the organization.

In addition, the concept of data sovereignty works alongside ownership to ensure that data is being subjected to the laws and regulations of the area the data owner is located in. For example, the framework of Indigenous data sovereignty (IDSOV), ensures the data is owned by the Indigenous communities it is extracted from. The tribal nation has the right to control all data that has been collected from their community. IDSOV uses the principles of CARE and FAIR to dictate how their data is collected, owned, used, and shared. 

- To learn more about what IDSOV is and review existing publications and projects that are currently using IDSOV as a model, please visit [The University of Arizona Native Nations Institute: Indigenous Data Sovereignty & Governance](https://nni.arizona.edu/our-work/research-policy-analysis/indigenous-data-sovereignty-governance). 
    
- To learn more about what the CARE principles are, review [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5d79c383e904c741c9e9cd86/1568260995760/CARE+Principles+for+Indigenous+Data+Governance_FINAL_Sept+06+2019.pdf). 
    
- To learn more about the FAIR principles read [What are FAIR principles?](https://library.cumc.columbia.edu/insight/what-are-fair-data-principles) and for more information on how to practice FAIR read the [3 Point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/).
    
- Read ‘[Operationalizing the CARE and FAIR Principles for Indigenous data futures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0#Sec7)’ for more information on how FAIR and CARE intersect. 
    

  

This is done to ensure the data is being used properly and ownership is better defined. It also helps reduce extractive data practices in vulnerable communities. However, it should be noted that data cannot be copyrighted, but there are data ownership practices that can be used including: 

- Licenses, such as the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), that can be used in place of a copyright. There are several types of CC licenses, but all of them ensure that there is a “standardized way to grant the public permission to use” any data created or collected by an organization. 
    
- Data ownership agreements can work to define who owns the data and who is responsible for managing, sharing, analyzing, and using the data. This typically involves all organizations that have a stake in the data. Please read our How To Guide: Data Co-Ownership for more information on data ownership agreements. 
    

  

When considering data ownership, ask these questions:

- Who owns the data I am collecting?
    
- Who is allowed to access the data?
    
- What rights do I have to publish the data?
    
- Does collecting these data impose any obligations on me?

Why does it matter? 

Data ownership is important to any party that has a stake in the data that is being collected because it ensures that all data is being used to derive benefit for the communities it impacts. Overall, data ownership allows for increased accountability and accuracy of the data collected as it is the owner’s responsibility to define the common practices around their data. In an environmental context, it is important to establish data ownership because it ensures the responsible collection, use, and analysis of environmental data for better decision-making and to inform environmental initiatives and climate action. This is especially important within vulnerable communities where extractive data practices have been prevalent. Historically, extractive data practices have prevented vulnerable communities from accessing or deriving benefits from their data. Data ownership empowers communities to use their data to make informed decisions regarding environmental initiatives within their community.
