**Why and How We Share Data 

Data supports **organization/project’s** commitment to **organization value #1,** **organization value #2**, and **organization value #3** . **If necessary, you can provide more context on organization values.** We collect, use, and share data in order to fulfill the following goals:

1. Why #1: provide one sentence of clarification and context
2. Why #2: provide one sentence of clarification and context
3. Why #3: provide one sentence of clarification and context

*→ An example of a why and clarification:* 
- “To connect our users to resources: Data supports our understanding of a given community or individual context, which allows us to tailor solutions to and generate resources for participants.”


The way that we use and share data is based on our core values. The following values dictate our practices surrounding data of all types. 

1. Value #1: provide one sentence of clarification and context
2. Value #2: provide one sentence of clarification and context
3. Value #3: provide one sentence of clarification and context

*→ An example of a value and clarification:* 
- "Privacy and confidentiality: We respect your privacy and confidentiality and have practices that safeguard your data as it relates to use and sharing. This is an extension of our principle to protect and serve communities, and so responsible stewardship of data is built into our workflows and governance.”


We collect, use, and share different types of data, including **data types (e.g., aggregate data, individual and property-level data, personal identifiable information, and contact information).** 

1. Data type #1: provide one sentence of what this type of data is, provide one sentence on how this data is used, what you will or won’t do with this type of data
2. Data type #2: provide one sentence of what this type of data is, provide one sentence on how this data is used, what you will or won’t do with this type of data
3. Data type #3: provide one sentence of what this type of data is, provide one sentence on how this data is used, what you will or won’t do with this type of data

  

→ An example of a data type explanation and use: 
- "Personal identifiable information (PII): Personal identifiable information is the most sensitive type of information and can include personal contact information like individual address, date of birth, or phone number. We share this data internally, and in some cases, with funders in required grant reporting. We do not share this information externally in any circumstance.”
