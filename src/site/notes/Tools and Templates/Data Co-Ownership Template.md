> [!NOTE]
> For a copy of the Data Co-Ownership Template that you can make a copy of and use, [view here on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VcqY6UISSBo4GeuUtNspfvYP4XZ7gyMxn-46cfAe51Y/edit?usp=sharing). 

 
*Note that this is not a template for a legal document, but designed to be used more like a memorandum of understanding. 

**→ Start with a statement that declares who owns the data, and if that is dependent on who collects it.**  

*Example:* Data collected by Self-Help Enterprises remains the property of Self-Help Enterprises and the program participant. 


**→ The following categories can be incorporated into the agreement based on what the data owner’s prioritize in their partnership.** 

How can I access data collected?
*Example:* Participants will have access to their data through a portal, linked here. Participants can see data linked to their property but no other data from other properties. You can access the data for as long as we are using the data service, or for as long as the grant period lasts. 


What are the ways it will be used?
*Example:* This is what we intend to do with the data: list specific activities. The data will not and can not be used to monitor individual properties or survey well levels. We will not monetize or sell your data under any circumstances. 


What happens if the data needs to be shared with a new party?
*Example:* In the future, we may pursue new projects that will require sharing with new partners. We pursue partnerships that support our mission and goals, which you can read more about here. We will always notify you of potential changes and ask for consent, and if you choose not to share with this new partner, we will omit your data. If you do not respond to the consent request, after 60 days, we will continue with the proposed sharing with new parties. 


What information has to be shared?
*Example:* We are required to share certain information with the California State Water Resources Control Board. We are required to share if a probe has been installed at a property and aggregate information about water levels at a regional scale. 


What are the conditions of deletion?
*Example:* If the participant would like to discontinue working with Self-Help Enterprises well monitoring program in the future, they may notify Self-Help Enterprises in writing (by email or letter) or by calling the office add phone number here to revoke any permissions previously granted. Self-Help Enterprises will uninstall the probe and there will be no further tracking. Participants’ personal identifiable information (e.g. contact information) will be retained due to grant reporting needs. 


**→ Include space for both data co-owners to sign and date.**
