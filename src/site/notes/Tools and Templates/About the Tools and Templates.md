We create templates and tools for using and sharing environmental data safely, equitably, and effectively. Most of the templates and tools correspond to a detailed play ([[Plays/About the Plays\|About the Plays]]) or case study ([[About the Case Studies)\|About the Case Studies)]] though others may originate from other workshops or events.
