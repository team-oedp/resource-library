# The Resource Library for Community Data is a virtual learning space to find resources, templates, and guidance for using and sharing environmental data safely, equitably, and effectively.


This Library is designed for community environmental and climate data users, collectors, managers, stewards, and organizations. That includes:

- Community-based environmental and climate justice organizations interested in using data for planning, research, programming, or advocacy;
- Community or citizen scientists;
- Members of the public who want to set up or maintain local environmental monitoring or collection efforts; and
- Researchers who use community-generated environmental data.


The **knowledge graph** on the right shows the connections between the different pages. You can isolate different pages and highlight their connections by clicking on the word/dot. 

**We’re open to collaboration, so if you’re interested in learning more about environmental data governance, utilizing a play, or collaborating to test out a play, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2yk7rCum5FtBwtQwE9UXBAB9f8CGt0TJeextkVN57cyIGHg/viewform?usp=dialog) and someone from the OEDP team will be in touch.**

  
This Resource Library is maintained and created by the [Open Environmental Data Project.](https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/)
