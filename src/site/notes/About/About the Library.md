This Library is designed for community environmental and climate data users, collectors, managers, stewards, and organizations. That includes:

- Community-based environmental and climate justice organizations interested in using data for planning, research, programming, or advocacy;
- Community or citizen scientists;
- Members of the public who want to set up or maintain local environmental monitoring or collection efforts; and
- Researchers who use community-generated environmental data.


**We’re open to collaboration, so if you’re interested in learning more about environmental data governance, utilizing a play, or collaborating to test out a play, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2yk7rCum5FtBwtQwE9UXBAB9f8CGt0TJeextkVN57cyIGHg/viewform?usp=dialog) and someone from the OEDP team will be in touch.**
