# What is it?

Simply put, open data is data that “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” ([Open Knowledge Foundation](https://opendefinition.org/)). 

There is a spectrum of open data, with at one end, there is completely open data. This is data that anyone can access, use, or share. Accessing data must be convenient and free for users, and available in its complete form. People accessing this data can download and reuse the data, combine with other datasets, perform analyses, and redistribute it in different forms. Along this spectrum, there can be “shades” of openness, meaning that the data may have specific conditions for reuse or access. Here are some examples of those shades:

- Data is publicly available, but users must create a login that includes your email address so that the data owners can understand who is downloading or viewing the data
    
- Data is publicly available, but users must attribute the owners if data is repackaged or republished in a new format
    
- Data is available to those who are a part of a specific community but not the general public
    
- Data is available, but not in its original form, but as a specific data product (e.g. a heat map or chart)
    
- Data is licensed to be used in a specific way (e.g. [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) or research licenses)
    
- Data is labeled as Traditional Knowledge to identify and clarify community-specific rules and responsibilities regarding access and future use of traditional knowledge (this method is specifically used by [the Local Contexts organization](https://localcontexts.org/))
    

  

There are principles that support open data, known as FAIR and CARE. FAIR is an acronym that stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets, and these principles are guidelines to support research and scholarly discovery through good data management. The principles are directly linked to practices. While FAIR was initially designed to support researchers in a scholarly setting, these principles and practices are useful for community scientists and data owners as well. 

  

Findability refers to the ability to search for data. Metadata that is complete and machine readable is essential for discovery. (You can read more about metadata here.) Accessibility is the next step, and ensures that users can see and use the data free of cost and with simple digital tools. Interoperability refers to the ability of the data to be integrated with other data sources and applications for analysis, processing, and storage. Reusability is the ultimate goal of the FAIR practices, and means that the data and its metadata are well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

The Global Indigenous Data Alliance created the CARE Principles in recognition of the need for Indigenous data sovereignty alongside open data principles and practices. The emphasis that FAIR and the broader open data movement were putting on greater data sharing alone didn’t account for considerations that Indigenous people have when collecting, using, and storing data that reflect power differentials and the historical contexts ([CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf)). There was a need to create a framework that reflected the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. CARE is an acronym that stands for Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics. Collective Benefit refers to the principle that data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data. The Authority to Control denotes that Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered through data governance. Responsibility is linked to the principle that people  working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self determination and collective benefit and are accountable through their actions. Ethics underscores the principle that Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.

# Why does it matter? 

Open data, and the principles, practices, and movement surrounding it, are significant for any community collecting and using environmental data. Open data practices can influence the governance model that communities use and the technical considerations of management; there are options and opportunities for sharing data in a manner that allows for its productive use without risks for community members.
