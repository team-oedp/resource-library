In 2024, the Open Environmental Data Project (OEDP) launched an open call for participation in a workshopping space for community partners to work through environmental data governance questions and challenges. We partnered with three communities that were collecting environmental data, each situated in a distinct social and environmental context, and conducted workshops to identify and co-design governance solutions. Emelia Williams (OEDP) worked alongside Kate Wing ([Intertidal Agency](https://www.intertidalagency.org/)) to design and facilitate planning meetings, workshops, resources, and debriefs with each community partner.

The following three case studies delve into the collaborations we had with our community partners: Self-Help Enterprises in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley, Community Health Aligning Revitalization Resilience and Sustainability (CHARRS) in Atlanta, Georgia, and CoAct in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
