[[Decoders/Indigenous Data Sovereignty\|Indigenous Data Sovereignty]]
 
What is it?

A [[Decoders/Data Sharing\|Data Sharing]] agreement (DSA) is a legal contract that outlines how data will be shared and used between different parties. DSAs describe how the data will be shared, how it should be used, who it can be shared with, and any restrictions that apply to the data. This helps protect the subjects of the data as well as the people involved in the agreement. 

  

When creating or adopting a DSA it is important to ask: “What are the modalities of how data can be shared - on what conditions and to what degree?” ([The Data Economy Lab - AAPTI](https://thedataeconomylab.com/mindmap/)) Key things to consider when answering this question and creating a DSA are:

- Roles and responsibilities: Define who is responsible for managing the data at every point of the data lifecycle. This ensures only authorized personnel have access to the data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. ([FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/DATA-SHA.PDF))
    
- Data access and use: Specify how the data can be used, who can access it, and any restrictions on its use. By creating clear guidelines on the access and use of the data, there is less risk of the data being misused or improperly shared. ([FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/DATA-SHA.PDF))
    
- Data format: Provide guidelines on how the data will be formatted (e.g. file type, field titles and types) to ensure that the recipient is able to access and use the data efficiently. ([FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/DATA-SHA.PDF))

There are many DSA templates available to guide the development of a DSA for environmental data:

- [Cecil Earth](https://cecilearth.notion.site/Nature-Data-Sharing-Initiative-11bef16bbbe480ed9c13ef1a8cc939c2) provides resources for safe and responsible data sharing. Their DSA worksheet and template can be found here: [Nature Data Sharing Initiative](https://docsend.com/view/qhe9fci2ifhkurh9).
    
- [Central Coast Indigenous Resource Alliance](https://www.ccira.ca/) has created a template for improved indigenous data sovereignty among tribal nations whose data are being collected. Find it here: [Information Sharing Agreement Template](https://www.indigenousguardianstoolkit.ca/sites/default/files/Community%20Resource_Central%20Coast%20Indigenous%20Resource%20Alliance_Draft%20Information%20Sharing%20Agreement%20Template_0.pdf) 
    
- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created a template for their data sharing plan for grants and cooperative agreements. The template can be accessed here: [Memorandum of Agreement](https://www.iho-machc.org/documents/seabed2030/Agendas/NOAA%20Data%20Sharing%20Agreement%20Template_USA.pdf). They have also developed a [FAQ](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DataSharingPlanFAQ_2020.pdf) for their data sharing plans for any questions and clarifications. 
    
- The [National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR)](https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/) has developed a data sharing plan for the use of their data in environmental decision making. It can be found here: [APPENDIX D: Data Sharing Plan (Example)](https://nerrssciencecollaborative.org/media/files/NERRS_Example_Data_Sharing_Plan.pdf).
    

  

Templates should be used as guidance and adjusted to the needs of the parties involved in the DSA. In addition, legal counsel should be consulted in order to finalize a DSA. 

  

Why is it important?

Data sharing agreements are an important part of any environmental data project because they protect data from misuse and increase transparency and trust. DSAs open up discussions about data handling and use between the parties involved in the agreement. This improves data security and protects the subject of the data. In addition, DSAs promote accessible data sharing by creating clear guidelines on how the data should be used and limit the potential of private information being incorrectly shared.
