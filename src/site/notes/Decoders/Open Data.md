### **What is it?**
Open data is data that “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” ([Open Knowledge Foundation](https://opendefinition.org/)). 

Accessing data must be convenient and free for users, and available in its complete form. People accessing this data can download and reuse the data, combine it with other datasets, perform analyses, and redistribute it in different forms. There can be “shades” of openness, meaning that the data may have specific conditions for #reuse or #access. 

Here are some examples of where data might exist on a spectrum of openness:
- Data is publicly available, but users must create a login that includes your email address so that the data owners can understand who is downloading or viewing the data.
- Data is publicly available, but users must attribute the owners if data is repackaged or republished in a new format.
- Data is available to those who are a part of a specific community, but not the general public.
- Data is available, not in its original form, but as a specific data product (e.g., a heat map or chart).
- Data is licensed to be used in a specific way (e.g., [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), [Open Database licenses (ODbl)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), or research licenses may restrict commercial use).
- Data is labeled as Traditional Knowledge to identify and clarify community-specific rules and responsibilities regarding access and future use of traditional knowledge (this method is specifically used by [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/)).

There are principles that support open data, known as [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care). These principles are guidelines to support research and scholarly discovery through good data management, and are directly linked to practices ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/) and [CARE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0/figures/2) practices, respectively). While neither FAIR nor CARE should be equated with “open,” these principles are often used in support of or in conjunction with open principles.

### **Why does it matter?** 
Open data—and the principles, practices, and movement surrounding it—are significant for any community collecting and using environmental data because openness can support wide and equitable access, reuse, and ultimately impact. Open data practices can influence the governance model that communities use and the technical considerations for #management; there are options and opportunities for sharing data in a manner that allows for its productive use without risks to community members.
