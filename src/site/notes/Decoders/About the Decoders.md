Data Decoders are basic articles on topics related to data governance and stewardship. The Decoders together make a glossary tailored to environmental data stewards’ use; each term includes the definition and explores how that term is used in  environmental data governance. Each Decoder also lists additional resources for deeper exploration. 

  

We add to and update the glossary of Data Decoders quarterly.
