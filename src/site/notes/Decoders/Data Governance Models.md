What is it?

Environmental data is an essential tool for monitoring and evaluating major environmental issues. Navigating these complex issues requires context specific data practices to ensure accuracy, accessibility, and overall collective benefit of the data. In order to do this, environmental data stewards can use a data governance model. 

  

Data governance models are frameworks or sets of practices that outline how an organization manages and uses their environmental data. They encompass the social, legal, and technical aspects of the data lifecycle from collection to dissemination “to minimize risks, ensure accountability, and optimize data assets.” ([The World Bank](https://digitalregulation.org/navigating-data-governance-a-guiding-tool-for-regulators/#:~:text=Data%20governance%20refers%20to%20the,accountability%2C%20and%20optimize%20data%20assets.))

  

The goal of data governance models is to reduce harm and avoid extractive practices by defining the responsibilities and methods of managing data throughout its lifecycle.  Some of the key principles that data governance models work to achieve its goals are transparency, stewardship, and privacy and control. 

- Transparency is key to accessibility and building trust. Data transparency involves being open about the procedures in place for handling data. This provides teams with the information they need to properly collect and manage data. (Shannon Dosemagen, 2020)
    
- Stewardship ensures accountability by defining and assigning responsibilities for how the data will be used, managed, and shared. Stewardship provides structure and accountability for data workflows and sharing. (Siddharth Manoha, 2020)
    
- Privacy and control needs to be a fundamental part of any governance model to ensure all identifying private information is kept safe from collection to dissemination. (Shannon Dosemagen, 2020)

- To explore the considerations needed to apply a data governance model to an environmental project, read Shannon Dosemagen and Elizabeth Tyson’s article [Data Governance Models and the Environmental Context: Part 3](https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/research-series/data-governance-models-and-the-environmental-context-part-3).
    
- The GovLab and The Democratic Society published their report, [Governing the Environment-Related Data Space](https://medium.com/data-policy/governing-the-environment-related-data-space-98794ed9accb), that discusses their research on the best approaches to governing data for “greater social and environmental impact”.
    
- Aapti Institute has done research with the Omidyar Network on understanding data stewardship. You can read some of their findings here [Data Stewardship: A Taxonomy](https://thedataeconomylab.com/2020/06/24/data-stewardship-a-taxonomy/) 
    

  

These concepts have helped develop many models that each have a different approach and focus, but can be easily adjusted to the needs of the organization and serve to enhance the management of data from collection to dissemination. There are various types of data governance models and each can be adjusted to meet the specific needs of the organization. Three widely know data governance models include:

- Data Trusts are a legal framework that assigns the role of data steward to uphold and maintain data rights. The data subjects, those whose data is being collected, define the role of data steward and establish their expectations, goals, and standards for the data. The steward is expected to make decisions regarding the data with the established rights as their guideline to allow for increased accountability in decisions. In addition, trusts increase the control the data subjects have over their personal data and who has access to it. However, there is potential for power imbalances and unclear or poorly defined interests when the data subjects are not all on the same page. Overall, data trusts are still a fairly new form of governance for environmental data. One example of how a data trust has been successfully used is the Australian Farm Data Code that was developed by [Australia's National Farmers’ Federation (ANFF)](https://nff.org.au/programs/australian-farm-data-code/) to provide farmers control over how their data is being used and shared.

- Data Collaboratives emphasize the importance of collaboration between different organizations to establish data collection, sharing, and processing practices. The goal of a data collaborative is to drive innovation and derive collective benefit for all. They also help foster trust between organizations and ensure the overall safety of the data by defining the data sharing process. However, collaboratives do not place governance and ownership as a guiding principle. Typically the organization is seen as the data owner and limits the engagement of the subjects of the data. There is still a lot to be learned about data collaboratives in the environmental space but there are a few collaboratives already acting:
    

- The [California Data Collaborative (“CaDC”)](https://www.californiadatacollaborative.org/) coalition of water utilities is working to “revolutionize the data infrastructure of California's water management… to automate the collection and analysis of metered water use from participating agencies. This information will allow for the creation of a more accurate dataset that details how much, when and where water was used by Californian residents.” ([The Data Economy Lab](https://thedataeconomylab.com/explorer/california-data-collaborative-cadc-coalition-of-water-utilities/)) 
    
- [Data for Climate Action (D4CA)](http://dataforclimateaction.org/) is a challenge established by the UN to “harness data science and big data from the private sector to fight climate change. The challenge aims to leverage private big data to identify revolutionary new approaches to climate mitigation and adaptation.” ([The Data Economy](https://thedataeconomylab.com/explorer/data-for-climate-action-d4ca/))

However, there are challenges to the implementation of these models. 

- Data silos, or data managed by a single group, make it difficult to create an open model that allows for the easy flow of information to be used for decision making and access for data stewardship. 
    
- Collaboration is necessary between internal and external stakeholders in order to build trust and prevent extractive practices. 
    
- Time and resources are needed to maintain and uphold an environmental data governance model successfully. 
    
- If organizations fail to define and agree on a common definition of governance and how it applies to their environmental projects, there will be gaps in data literacy and the responsibilities of each stakeholder.
    

  

When establishing a new data governance model, consider these questions:

- What is your goal of establishing a data governance model? 
    
- Does the data governance framework support all phases of the expected lifespan of the data, including data collection, storage, and archiving?
    
- Are there policies and procedures already in place to control user data access, limiting what data can be accessed depending on job roles and responsibilities? 
    
- Are there standards for data integration and information exchange?

Why does it matter? 

Data governance models promote trust, accessibility, and usability of environmental data reducing data silos caused by uncoordinated methods of data management. 

- Accessibility: When using data governance models, project teams can develop common practices and standardizations for labeling data to promote engagement with data across the environmental sector and among communities from which the data was collected. These models and practices ensure data is made accessible for the community it is collected from to use it to drive community-led climate mitigation strategies and promote environmental justice through the use of data. 
    
- Trust: Data integrity and trust is increased because of the privacy controls and transparent procedures created by governance models. Stakeholders are kept well informed and have clear expectations of what their role is in handling the data.
    
- Usability: Data governance models can define the responsibilities of each stakeholder to better ensure data is accurately collected, cleaned, analyzed, and stored. With clear procedures, data is easier to find and use across the environmental sector.**
