What is it?  
Data quality assurance (DQA) is the process of checking data to ensure it meets the expected standards set by a project. DQA creates reliable and accurate data by identifying and removing any inconsistencies found in the data. 

  

The goals of a good DQA plan are:

- Develop a routine quality assurance system to reduce errors in data. 
    
- Describe how and when data quality assessments will be implemented.
    

- Implement a clear strategy for responding to data quality problems.
    

([USAID Data Quality Assurance](https://www.fsnnetwork.org/sites/default/files/Data_quality_%20assurance_short.pdf)).

Environmental data quality assurance is created by adhering to the existing methods and procedures put in place by the organization. 

  

Examples of DQA processes implemented:

- [The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality](https://deq.wyoming.gov/) has developed a DQA program to oversee the Water Quality Division. The goal of their program is to ensure their environmental data “aligns with standard scientific methods, state statutes, and federal regulations for defensible decision-making” ([WYDEQ](https://deq.wyoming.gov/water-quality/data-quality-assurance/)). Read more about their program here: [Water Quality Division: Data Quality Assurance](https://deq.wyoming.gov/water-quality/data-quality-assurance/)
    
- The EPA has put together resources on how to use DQA processes to evaluate environmental data. Review their resources at [Guidance for Data Quality Assessment](https://www.epa.gov/quality/guidance-data-quality-assessment).
    
- The [Environmental Data Quality Workgroup](https://www.denix.osd.mil/edqw/#:~:text=With%20representatives%20from%20Army%2C%20Navy,testing%20operations%2C%20and%20data%20quality.) includes representatives from Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency, to “develop and recommend DoD policy pertaining to environmental sampling, laboratory testing operations, and data quality.”
    

  

Why is it important?

DQA is important for environmental data because it creates accurate and reliable data that can be used for decision making. It also decreases the errors and likelihood of inaccurate information being circulated. This is especially important as data sharing practices become more common. It’s important to ensure that there is trust and transparency around environmental data to continue promoting open data and the use of available environmental data for research.
