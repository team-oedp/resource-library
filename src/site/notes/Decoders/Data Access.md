### What is it? 

Data access refers to the availability of environmental data to the public. This means the access to easily retrieve and use the data. With the growing amount of environmental data being collected, it is important to make that data accessible to people who are working in the field, with certain limitations. Some data contains sensitive information that needs to be protected and access limited to ensure the safety and privacy of the data. In these cases, the data is limited to those who are part of the project team in charge of data management. Accessibility opens doors for collaboration, replication, and increased data-driven decision making. This is essential as the adverse effects of climate change worsen and environmental injustice persists.

  

To make data more accessible, it’s important to consider a couple of guidelines to make it easy to find, use, and keep the data safe. Data access should encompass the social and technical best practices and tools needed to ensure data is kept safe, easy to find, and usable. 

- Metadata, or information used to describe a dataset, can be used to better search for data. Metadata makes it easier for organizations to search for and use environmental data by providing easy to search for terms and information about the data.

- The Indigenous data sovereignty principle of FAIR promotes transparency and ease in finding data for reuse or informing decisions. FAIR stands for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse. 2 of the FAIR access practices are: 
    

- Findability: data should be easy to find and metadata is essential to making it findable. The use of metadata should also include resources to understand what metadata is available/searchable.
    
- Accessibility: Once the data has been found, it should be clear how it can be accessed. Accessibility may include limited access to data for safety and privacy reasons, authorization from the data owners, or even an agreement that outlines what kind of access is allowed.

- To get examples of how to uphold FAIR when reporting data review  [Enabling FAIR data in Earth and environmental science with community-centric (meta)data reporting formats](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01606-w#:~:text=Research%20can%20be%20more%20transparent,integrate%20with%20their%20scientific%20workflows).
    

- Access control is important to ensure that sensitive data does not get shared out. It makes the data easy to access while also safeguarding personal data. In addition, access control assigns responsibilities and rules for who can modify, share, and view the data. There are several kinds of access control. These are 2 examples of different access control:
    

- Role-based access control assigns different permissions and roles to users, restricting the ability to edit, view, and share the data. For example, a field technician surveying a community on their water access might only have access to collecting survey responses and reviewing the survey responses they’ve submitted. 
    
- Discretionary Access Control gives the owner of the data control of access. For example, if a data analyst owns a spreadsheet containing all available environmental data for their project, they have control over who can view or edit the spreadsheet.

There are many initiatives to make environmental data more accessible to the general public.

- [Climate and Health Outcomes Research Data Systems (CHORDS)](https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2024/8/science-highlights/climate-health-data) is a site launched to provide more robust data on climate and health outcomes to address the impacts of environmental factors on health. 
    
- [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edirepository.org/): provides access to environmental data that can be used for analysis, data training, and other resources to assess climate change impacts. 
    
- Data sharing models are available everywhere for different environmental topics. One example includes data sharing in hydrology to improve the usability and access to hydrology data. 
    

- [A data sharing method in the open web environment: Data sharing in hydrology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169420304339) 
    

  

Questions to ask when considering access to your project’s data:

- Who will be responsible for assigning access?
    
- Who needs access to the data and why? 
    
- How will the data be accessed or shared?
    
- What are the limitations of data usage once the data is accessed?
    
- What standards and procedures are in place to ensure clear accessibility guidelines?
    

  

Why is it important? 

There is so much environmental data being collected, but often it is not available because of data silos. Data silos refer to closed data, or data that is not available to the public or anyone outside of the data project. . Data silos make it difficult to know what data is out there and what has already been done to study different methods for climate mitigation. By making data accessible, we can prevent these data silos and promote the reuse of data to facilitate research and data driven decision making for environmental issues. 

  

Data access also increases the security of data by having checks in place to ensure the data is not manipulated or tampered with by unauthorized parties. These checks also improve the accuracy of data. Environmental data also becomes usable and easier to replicate when clear methods are shared out along with the data, allowing for the advancement of research and initiatives. 

  

The importance of accessible data can be seen in the review of the Brumadinho dam disaster in Brazil. This case study provides a perfect example of the importance of data accessibility to learn from environmental disasters and predict and prevent them.
