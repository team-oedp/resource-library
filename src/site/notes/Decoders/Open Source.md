### **What is it?**

[Open source](https://opensource.org/osd) generally refers to software, tools, and projects that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. Unlike [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software), where the code is restricted and controlled by a single entity, open-source projects make their source code publicly accessible. 

However, open source is more than just a technical specification; it’s a way of working that is rooted in collaboration, innovation, and transparency. To be open source, software projects must meet ten criteria, including:
1. **Free redistribution**: Anyone can include the project as part of a bigger project.
2. **Source code**: The program must provide access to the source code.
3. **Derived works**: The license must allow modifications.
4. **No discrimination against persons or groups**: The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

  

Some of the most influential open-source projects include:

- [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), an open-source operating system, powers everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library for data visualization, enables stunning graphics for researchers and analysts.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), an open-source content management system, drives over 40% of websites globally.


But open source isn’t limited to software,  it also includes [hardware designs](https://digital-naturalism-laboratories.github.io/Mothbox/), [educational resources](https://guides.monmouth.edu/Open_Source), [scientific research](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/), and even [art](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/open-access-images). It’s about sharing knowledge and iterating through problem solving.

  

### **Why is it important?**

Open source is a cultural and ethical framework based on sharing, #collaboration, and problem solving. For community environmental data users, using open source can lead to more adaptable and community driven solutions. Here’s why it matters:

1. **Flexible**: Open source allows users to customize software to suit their needs. This flexibility helps organizations avoid vendor lock-in and expensive licensing fees.
2. **Community-Driven**: Open-source projects thrive because of the communities that work on them. People from around the world contribute their expertise to improve the tools functionality, fix bugs, and add features. 
3. **Transparency:** Since open-source code is available to the public, anyone can audit it for vulnerabilities. This transparency allows for trust to develop within the tool’s community.
4. **Cost**: Open source tools can often be more cost effective in the long run when compared with tools that charge per user.
