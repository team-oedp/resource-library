[[Decoders/Data Sharing Agreements\|Data Sharing Agreements]]


What is it and why does it matter?

Data sharing, simply, is making data available to another party. This could include sharing with a partnering environmental non-profit, a researcher at a university, a community group, or a government agency. Sharing your environmental data can present many benefits, including:

  

- A researcher could use the data to write a paper that demonstrates the levels of pollution and links to governmental or industry action

- Government agencies can respond to environmental health issues with the help of regulatory scientists

Sharing data allows for communities that have environmental data to build partnerships, inform their neighbors and region, and analyze information and impact over time. While there are benefits to sharing, there are also risks; environmental data can be used by bad actors to misrepresent or draw conclusions about communities. This could include: lowering home values or increasing insurance rates based on perceived risk, extractive research practices, or misrepresentation in media. 

  

Fortunately, there are tools to support safeguards when sharing data, including licenses, data sharing agreements, and various modes of data governance models that can protect environmental data while ensuring its value can be used for and by the community.
