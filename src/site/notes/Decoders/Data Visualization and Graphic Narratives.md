What is it? 

Data Visualization is the process of turning data into a useful, visual format. Data visualization is required because quantitative data is created as numbers with labels, which on their own are not easily interpretable by humans. With just a sheet of numbers and labels, it can be very hard to make sense of what the data means, coming up with trends in the data, or providing insights from the data. It is also hard to determine patterns or things that are out of the ordinary. 

  

With data visualization, those numbers are taken and put into some sort of visual format that allows a person to see the outliers or patterns quickly and easily. Humans prefer visual data because they are much better at processing the information when it is visual compared to a table of numbers. In short, data visualization makes data more useful and understandable to humans.

  

Some common tools for data visualization are:

- QGIS or ArcGIS for Geospatial and environmental data
    
- Tableau or PowerBI for visualizing different types of data using graphs and charts
    
- Python has packages like Seaborn and plotly that allow for visualization
    
- Microsoft Excel can also be used to make visualizations such as graphs and charts
    

  
Why does it matter?  

 Environmental data can be experienced daily and we might be able to notice it on a daily basis. For example, walking past a river daily a person may notice that the water is high or low on a particular day. Even with complete records recording that daily observation, a person may have trouble determining patterns or trends in the data. A longer timespan makes it more difficult to detect the patterns from just observation alone. Data visualization allows us to put together a “picture” of the data which can tell you more about what is happening in the environment. Given that environmental data can be cyclical, these patterns can be very hard to interpret without first visualizing the data.
