[[Decoders/Data Sharing\|Data Sharing]]

What is it?

Environmental data sometimes requires the collection of potentially sensitive data. This might include information about air or water quality near someone’s home and community, which if released widely, may affect home values or insurance costs. Some environmental data might include personally identifiable information (PII) or any information that can be used to identify a person. To address risks associated with sensitive data, clear methods for safeguarding sensitive data need to be created. Simply put, data privacy and security refers to the policies in place to protect private information. 

  

The goals of privacy and security should include: 

- Data minimization: Only collect what is needed and nothing more. Only necessary personal data should be collected to reduce the risks associated with data breaches.
    
- Confidentiality: Only share the data that is needed and nothing more. When possible, redact any personal identifiable information to protect the subject of the data. This builds trust and provides 
    
- Data stewardship: Establishing the role of data steward(s) is important because they dictate how the data is managed, this includes privacy and security decisions. For environmental data, it’s crucial to set clear expectations around data sharing and access to prevent the risks associated with the data. 
    

  

Some best practices to consider when developing privacy and security guidelines include:

- Data governance models reduce the risk for data breaches by putting policies in place that protect data at every stage. In addition, clear roles are set to reduce the amount of people who are manipulating and viewing data.
    
- Data risk assessments involve reviewing sensitive data to identify and prevent potential risks, such as data breaches, data loss, and unauthorized access.
    
- Encryption and anonymization are both data security controls that help secure PII. This reduces the likelihood of data being misused or incorrectly shared. 
    

- Anonymization: Data anonymization refers to removing or modifying any PII that will identify an individual (ex: phone number, address, email, etc.) to make it unlikely to identify anyone within the data set. 
    
- Encryption: Data encryption makes data unreadable by using a secret key or algorithm so only authorized users can access or decrypt the data. This helps enhance the security of the data because unauthorized users cannot access or manipulate the data.

- Data privacy frameworks are a set of processes that protect sensitive data and assess the potential risks. There are many privacy frameworks available including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Privacy Framework. This framework is aimed to help identify and manage privacy risk and protect sensitive data. It is made to be flexible and easily adapted to the needs of the organization. Read more about the NIST Privacy Framework [here](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework).
    
- Consider if there are datasets that could be shared as specific data products instead of as raw data sources. For example, an organization could share a map with aggregate neighborhood-level information instead of property-level information.
    
- Developing a response plan: Project teams can develop a response plan to address data breaches and unauthorized access to the data. This should include informing all stakeholders, assessing the risk of the breach, and addressing the breach to mitigate any potential harm. 
    
- For more information on the best methods for selecting a framework that fits your needs, review ‘[A Guide to Selecting and Adopting a Privacy Framework](https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2021/volume-2/a-guide-to-selecting-and-adopting-a-privacy-framework)’.
    

  
  

Questions to consider when adopting or creating a privacy and security framework:

- Who should be involved? 
    
- What data or datasets are most at risk of misuse?
    
- Are there datasets that should be closed completely?
    
- If the data is sensitive, how can we share data products (e.g. maps, charts, statistics) instead of raw data?
    
- Are there any privacy and security tools or practices already in place? 
    
- Do we need legal protections?
    
- What resources, like data sharing agreements, can we create to bolster data security?
    

  

Why does it matter? 

Data security and privacy helps prevent data breaches, safeguarding personal information collected to help combat extractive data practices. By creating transparent and clear security and privacy guidelines, communities gain trust in the organization collecting data because they are combatting the extractive data practices that have impacted these communities. This helps facilitate better relationships for maintaining and implementing sustainable environmental solutions in vulnerable communities. Data privacy and security also enables collaboration and innovation in the environmental sector by outlining clear protocols for safe data sharing.
