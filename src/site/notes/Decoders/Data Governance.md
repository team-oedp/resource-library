# What is it?

Data governance is the broad term under which things like data stewardship, data policies and standards, and data management sit. Simply put, it is how groups deal with data management. 

  
One part of data governance is data stewardship, that is, the people or groups that work as intermediaries between the data providers and data requesters. These people make sure the data is correct, shareable, and used in ways that are aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives (Manohar et al., 2020). Data stewards maintain the data in a way that allows for it to be accessible and accurate. It falls under the umbrella of data governance because these stewards decide who has access, under what conditions, and to whose benefit (Mills, 2020).

  

Another part of data governance are the policies and standards which are the rules about how to handle data (i.e. who can access, how they can access, what data they can access). They include guidelines for data privacy, security, and how to use data ethically, such as the FAIR and CARE principles. These policies should be used to ensure: 

- data quality (i.e. ensuring that the data aligns is correct and aligns with its intended uses), 
    
- data access (i.e. ensuring that the data can be accessed by the appropriate parties), 
    
- metadata (i.e. ensuring that information about the data is retained for provenance, credit, or traceability), 
    
- data lifecycle (i.e. where the data came from, is stored, and where it will go) (Khatri and Brown, 2010). 
    

  

# Why does it matter?

Data governance is important within the realm of environmental data because it ensures data quality and accuracy. High quality data that comes from a good data governance plan ensures that the data is usable by many different stakeholders (e.g. researchers, policymakers, and the public). With high quality data, these groups can make informed decisions about the environment. Along with high quality data, consistent data formats and clear paths to data access allows for data users to merge and compare datasets when doing environmental research.
