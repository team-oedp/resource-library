[[Decoders/Data Ownership\|Data Ownership]]


What is it?

Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSOV) is a framework that ensures the data is owned by the indigenous communities it is extracted from. This means the tribal nation has the right to control all data that has been collected from their community. IDSOV uses the principles of [CARE](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/the-care-principles/) and [FAIR](https://snd.se/en/manage-data/prepare-and-share/FAIR-data-principles) to dictate how their data is collected, owned, used, and shared. CARE stands for collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics. It was designed for the management of Indigenous data. CARE is meant to derive the most benefit from the data and highlight the importance of data in advancing innovation. FAIR stands for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. It provides guidelines and standards for using metadata to make data easy to find, use, and replicate. A well known example of IDSOV in practice is the Te Mana Raraunga Māori Data Sovereignty Network. The network’s goal is to enable Māori Data Sovereignty and to advance collective benefit for Māori.

- To learn more about what the CARE principles are, review [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5d79c383e904c741c9e9cd86/1568260995760/CARE+Principles+for+Indigenous+Data+Governance_FINAL_Sept+06+2019.pdf). 
    
- To learn more about the FAIR principles read [FAIR Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and for more information on how to practice FAIR read the [3 Point FAIRification Framework](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/).
    
- Read ‘[Operationalizing the CARE and FAIR Principles for Indigenous data futures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00892-0#Sec7)’ for more information on how FAIR and CARE intersect. 
    

  

Why is it important?

IDSOV works to empower indigenous communities who have historically been exploited for their data without any direct benefits. By giving the control and management of data back to Indigenous communities, they have more power to actively participate in environmental decision-making processes for improved outcomes. In addition, they have the opportunity to better protect their culture and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) for increased climate resilience and sustainable livelihoods. TEK is the knowledge and practices, passed down through generations, of the relationship between living things and their environment. 

Indigenous communities have seen extractive data practices impact their communities, in which outside researchers or organizations steal and misuse TEK without the participation of the community members who hold the knowledge. ([Warm Regard, 2021](https://ourwarmregards.medium.com/indigenous-climate-knowledges-and-data-sovereignty-4fc756b9476e)). These Indigenous communities usually do not see the findings of the research and they are left without compensation, acknowledgment, or direct benefit to the community. IDSOV provides an equitable model to reduce the exploitative practices from non-indigenous organizations. 

  

Resources

- The Watershed Future Initiatives developed an IDSOV toolkit to support the adoption of IDSOV for the governance of Indigenous data related to climate change in the in salmon watersheds across Canada. It can be found here: [Indigenous Data Sovereignty Salmon Watersheds Tool Kit](https://www.watershedfuturesinitiative.com/_files/ugd/54efec_23457de908604ab7bf0bdd0454384a59.pdf).
    
- The Climate and Traditional Knowledges Workgroup created guidelines for using TEK for climate action in response to the “increas[ed] recognition of the significance of traditional knowledge (TKs) in relation to climate change” ([CTKW, 2014](https://climatetkw.wordpress.com/guidelines/)). The guidelines are meant to identify and prevent risk to the Indigenous communities the knowledge comes from. You can download the guideline here: [Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives](https://climatetkw.wordpress.com/guidelines/).
