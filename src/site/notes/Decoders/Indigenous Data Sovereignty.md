### **What is it?**

Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) provides “a framework for maximizing the benefit of [[Decoders/Open Data\|open data]] for Indigenous peoples and other users of Indigenous data and for affecting the stewardship of all data” ([Carroll et al., Issues in Open Data: Indigenous Data Sovereignty](https://nnigovernance.arizona.edu/issues-open-data-indigenous-data-sovereignty?_gl=1*mec3tn*_gcl_au*MTg3NDgwMDU4My4xNzM3NTc0MTcx*_ga*MjAwOTY0OTA3LjE3Mzc1NzQxNzI.*_ga_7PV3540XS3*MTczODY5NjQ2My41LjAuMTczODY5NzQwNi4wLjAuMTMxMDM5Mjk5NQ..)). 

The #CARE principles, specifically designed as Indigenous data governance principles, include collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics. While the #FAIR principles are also recognized and utilized within IDSov, “emphasis on greater data sharing alone creates a tension for Indigenous Peoples who are also asserting greater control over the application and use of Indigenous data and Indigenous Knowledge for collective benefit” ([The Global Indigenous](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) [Data Alliance](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/6397b363b502ff481fce6baf/1670886246948/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf)). 

A well known example of IDSov in practice is the [Te Mana Raraunga Māori Data Sovereignty Network](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/). The network’s goal is to advance collective benefit for Māori and Iwi peoples and “advocate for Māori rights and interests in data to be protected as the world moves into an increasingly [[Decoders/Open Data\|open data]] environment” ([Māori Data Sovereignty Network](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/)). 

> [!NOTE]
> The [University of Arizona Native Nations Institute](https://nni.arizona.edu/our-work/research-policy-analysis/indigenous-data-sovereignty-governance) is at the forefront of IDSov research and application. They produce policy briefs, conduct and catalogue workshops and trainings, and assess and improve the strength of CARE implementation. 

  

### **Why is it important?**

The IDSov movement works to empower Indigenous communities who have historically been exploited for their data without any direct benefits. By giving the control and management of data back to Indigenous communities, they support empowerment and active participation in environmental decision-making processes for improved outcomes. In addition, they have the opportunity to better protect their culture and traditional ecological knowledge ([TEK](https://www.bia.gov/service/fuels-management/traditional-knowledge#:~:text=Traditional%20ecological%20knowledge%20\(TEK\)%20is,and%20forecast%20future%20forest%20implications.)) for increased climate resilience and sustainable livelihoods. TEK is the knowledge and practices, passed down through generations, surrounding the relationship between living things and their environment. 

Indigenous peoples have seen extractive data practices impact their communities, with outside researchers or organizations stealing and misusing TEK without the participation or permission of the community members who hold the knowledge ([Warm Regards](https://ourwarmregards.medium.com/indigenous-climate-knowledges-and-data-sovereignty-4fc756b9476e)). These Indigenous communities often do not see the findings of the research or are left without compensation, acknowledgment, or direct benefit to their community. IDSov provides an equitable model for reducing these exploitative practices in non-Indigenous organizations.

- The Watershed Future Initiatives developed the [Indigenous Data Sovereignty Salmon Watersheds Tool Kit](https://www.watershedfuturesinitiative.com/_files/ugd/54efec_23457de908604ab7bf0bdd0454384a59.pdf) to support the adoption of IDSov for the governance of Indigenous data related to climate change in salmon watersheds across Canada.
- The Climate and Traditional Knowledges Workgroup created [Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges in Climate Change Initiatives](https://climatetkw.wordpress.com/guidelines/) for using TEK for climate action in response to the “increased recognition of the significance of traditional knowledge (TKs) in relation to climate change.” The guidelines are meant to identify and prevent risk to the Indigenous communities from which the knowledge comes.
