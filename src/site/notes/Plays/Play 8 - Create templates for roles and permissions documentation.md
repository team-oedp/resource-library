##### **Takeaway: Risk exists, but deliberately designed data governance can create pathways for opening up data in responsible ways.**
Risk emerges in different ways when data sharing. Data misuse runs the gamut from truly harmful—misaligned actors can selectively choose data points to communicate harmful or untrue narratives—to merely inconsiderate—people could use data without acknowledging the original source.The risks of sharing data can rarely be fully eliminated, but there are practices and tools that can mitigate against potential threat.**
##### **Support play for intermediary organizations: Create templates for documentation of permissions and roles.**
It can be difficult to conduct conversations that formalize implicit understandings into more concrete governance policies. Intermediary organizations can create templates to serve as a starting point to guide organizations through conversations like this. A template like this can include a simple table with the roles listed in columns, and the activities that are usually allowed, require extra permission, or are always prohibited in rows alongside each role. The authors of [Building A Fisherman-First Data Ecosystem](https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/bitstream/handle/11329/1509/2019-Digital-Public-Report-1-Fisherman-First-Data-Ecosystem.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) provide a good example of this on page 24.
