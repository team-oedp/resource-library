### **Support play for intermediary organizations: Create templates for documentation of permissions and roles.**
It can be difficult to conduct conversations that formalize implicit understandings into more concrete governance policies. Intermediary organizations can create templates to serve as a starting point to guide organizations through conversations like this. A template like this can include a simple table with the roles listed in columns, and the activities that are usually allowed, require extra permission, or are always prohibited in rows alongside each role. The authors of [Building A Fisherman-First Data Ecosystem](https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/bitstream/handle/11329/1509/2019-Digital-Public-Report-1-Fisherman-First-Data-Ecosystem.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) provide a good example of this on page 24.

The risks of sharing data can rarely be fully eliminated, but there are practices and tools that can mitigate against potential threat.
