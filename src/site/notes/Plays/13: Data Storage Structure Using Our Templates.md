### **Technical play for data stewards: Implement a data #storage structure using our templates.**Â 
Weâ€™ve created templates so you can begin implementing a standardized structure for data storage. These templates provide predefined folder structures, naming conventions, and metadata requirements that help organize data systematically. They can save time, ensure consistency, and reduce confusion about where to store files or how to name them.

1. **Download** the template [linked here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WKnmxuh12tLB2NRkv0sKOHUEhagdbtEt?usp=drive_link). Review the structure to see what works for your organization and what doesnâ€™t.
2. **Adapt.** Use the [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyYDj5qw2Jud5j1Px27N0-md7Hwlupwu/view?usp=sharing) in the file to customize the template to your needs.Â 
	- Rename folders to reflect the specific data and processes you work with.
	- Adjust the folder hierarchies if needed (i.e., add, remove, or merge folders)
	- Customize file naming rules to reflect your organizationâ€™s workflows (i.e., include dates, versions, or author names)
3. **Test** the template with a small subset of data. Ask yourself:
	- Is the folder structure logical?Â 
	- Is information easy to find?
	- Will it work with other datasets?
4. **Pilot** the template with a small group of users, providing training for team members on its use.
	- Encourage the active use of the template for a set period of time.
	- Collect feedback from the pilot users. What are the pain points? What worked well?
5. **Roll out** the template to the rest of the organization.
	- Provide training and clear instructions for use.
	- Designate a point person to answer any questions.
	- Schedule periodic reviews and feedback sessions to ensure that things are working as intended.



#### ðŸŒ± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source. 

*Takeaway:* [[Decoders/Data Ownership\|Data ownership]] in practice has material requirementsâ€”somewhere to house the data and someone to maintain it.
Many organizations that collect environmental data do so because they have questions that demand answers; by collecting their own data, using their own hardware and methods, they can create their own data-informed knowledge and evidence. The concept of [[Decoders/Data Ownership\|data ownership]] recognizes this #knowledge creation, and underscores who has authority to use that data and in what ways. This concept is powerful, but it loses its potential without the infrastructure to store, manage, and maintain that data. While open source solutions have become more available, each of the plays below either document easy-to-implement methods to retain data ownership and store data, or present opportunities to support data stewards in finding solutions.
