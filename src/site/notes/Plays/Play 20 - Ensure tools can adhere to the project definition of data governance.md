##### **Because data governance can be understood and employed in many different ways, it is essential to define what data governance looks like within your project team.** 
Data governance encompasses the decision making rules, processes, workflows, and tools that determine who owns, manages, shares, and uses the data and how, as well as where the data is stored and shared. Different aspects of data governance may be prioritized differently depending on data stewards’ varying needs. For example, metadata and findability may be paramount to one organization, whereas protection of sensitive data may be the highest priority for another.


##### **Technical play for data stewards: Ensure your tools and workflows can adhere to your framework of data governance.** 
Evaluate each tool in your workflow to confirm that it aligns with your project’s data governance framework. This includes ensuring tools support key principles like data access restrictions, auditability, and version control. 

1. Map your governance policies (e.g., data privacy, access controls) to tool capabilities. For example, check if the tool allows role-based access or has built-in features for tracking changes to datasets.
2. Review your findings to identify areas for improvement and implement updates or customizations as needed.
3. Train team members on how to use the tools in a way that aligns with governance policies.
