### Relational play for data stewards: Build and use data values statements.
Just as an organizationâ€™s mission and values guide their purpose and align a teamâ€™s actions, a set of data values can provide a strategic direction for an organization that relies on using and sharing data to fulfill its goals. Internally, it creates a foundation for how to create data workflows, products, and infrastructures. Externally, these documents can serve as guides to set othersâ€™ expectations and convey organizational commitments.

#### ðŸŒ± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source.

*Takeaway:* Data values statements can create a basis for decision-making and team cohesion.
Data values statements are documents that describe how and why an organization or project uses data. They describe the purpose of the data use, and what the organization will or wonâ€™t do with the data it collects or uses. While data values statements are relatively new in the realm of data governance, they provide a normative space where data stewards can not only reach consensus on priorities but also provide a standard of what to expect in their collaborations.
