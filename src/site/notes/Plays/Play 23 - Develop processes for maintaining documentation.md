### **Technical play for data stewards: Develop processes for maintaining documentation.**Â 
The most useful #documentation isnâ€™t only created once, but rather updated regularly. Keeping documentation up-to-date ensures that everyone has access to the latest, most accurate information, reducing errors and confusion.
1. Assign responsibility for maintaining documentation to specific team members or roles.
2. Define a review cycle (e.g., quarterly or semi-annual) to ensure the documentation remains accurate and relevant.
3. Create a structured process for updates, including a checklist for content changes, stakeholder reviews, and approvals.
4. Ensure that folder and file nesting is consistent and that file naming conventions are followed.
5. Use collaborative tools (e.g., a dedicated documentation platform like GitBook, or Google Docs) to track contributions.
6. Share the updated documentation with users and archive older versions as needed.

#### ðŸŒ± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source.

*Takeaway:*  Documentation underlies effective collaborative data governance and institutional knowledge.
#Documentation about an organizationâ€™s data can include information on provenance, [[Decoders/Metadata\|metadata]] and other contextual information, how decisions are made, the methodology behind [[collection\|collection]], and data [[access\|access]] and use conditions. These types of documentation ensure that data can be understood and utilized by any user. Many organizations have an understanding of these aspects, but havenâ€™t made them explicit or published them alongside the data itself. Documentation allows for stewardsâ€™ or organizational knowledge to be safeguarded and transparent for the public, and also provides an avenue to examine how these aspects have changed over time.
