##### **Takeaway: Data values statements can create a basis for decision-making and team cohesion.** 
Data values statements are documents that describe how and why an organization or project uses data. They describe the purpose of the data use, and what the organization will or won’t do with the data it collects or uses. While data values statements are relatively new in the realm of data governance, they provide a normative space where data stewards can not only reach consensus on priorities but also provide a standard of what to expect in their collaborations.

##### **Technical play for data stewards: Develop a README for the technical implementer.** 
A values-oriented README serves as a guide and grounding document for technologists on your team. It communicates the expectations, principles, and commitments your program upholds, helping technologists align their work (whether within the cells of spreadsheets or entire databases) with your organizational or project goals.
- **Purpose Statement:** Explain why this README exists, including the importance of aligning technology with program goals and values.
- **Articulate Core Values:** List 3-5 core values that your program upholds. Ensure these reflect both organizational ethics and practical technology use. Explain why each value matters and how it applies to the work.
- **Detail Expectations for Technologists:** Describe the behaviors, practices, and outcomes your program expects from technologists (e.g., privacy and security practices, documentation requirements, accessibility needs).
- **Identify Ethical Boundaries:** Clearly articulate boundaries to prevent misunderstandings and protect program integrity. For example, in an environmental impact assessment project, an ethical boundary could be: 'No data on endangered species locations will be publicly disclosed so as to prevent potential poaching or habitat disturbance.’
- **Make it actionable:** Include detailed information that technologists can use to implement their work (e.g., specify which users can have access to which datasets).
- **Metadata:** Commit to revisiting and updating the README as necessary. Include when it was last updated and by whom. Stay current on metadata practices in environmental data collection in scientific and regulatory fields. Regularly consult resources such as the [National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI)](https://www.nemi.gov/home/) to ensure alignment with industry standards.

The values-oriented README template is available in the [Appendix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CbNUyczCF5N8j4scna2uY9Y8jSRJWhbhG4H1TULtc8I/edit?tab=t.ltsayx3cgu98) as Resource 5.
