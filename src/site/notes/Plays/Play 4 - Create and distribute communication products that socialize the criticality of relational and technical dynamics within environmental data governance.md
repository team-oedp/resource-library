### **Support Play for Intermediary Organizations: Create and distribute communication products that socialize the criticality of relational and technical dynamics within environmental data governance.**¬†
The interconnected nature of social and technical aspects of environmental data systems and data governance is becoming a more mainstream idea. But the stories documenting the practices, workflows, and processes that knit those two aspects together are hard to find and draw inspiration from.¬†

Intermediary organizations can create communication products, like slide decks, op-eds, presentations, and social media posts to make the ‚Äúcase‚Äù for the importance of interconnectedness within environmental data governance. For example, an organization could create a slide deck that includes supporting evidence on why this understanding of environmental data governance is needed and include use case scenarios of its efficacy within differing contexts. This slide deck‚Äôs utility is in its application: it could be shared among other intermediary organizations aligned with [[community science\|community science]], environmental justice, socio-environmental research, or the broader [[Decoders/Open Source\|open source]] data movement. It could also be shared with organizations and teams working directly with community-generated environmental data. It could be referenced during #fundraising and grant-writing, as a way to demonstrate critical understanding of this aspect of the data economy.




#### üå± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source. 

*Takeaway:* A strong connection between social, legal, and technical components is key to cohesive data governance. 
This is an overarching takeaway that underscores all plays in this playbook. Each of these plays works to build that cohesive bond between relational and technical infrastructure, and can be employed according to the levels of capacity, interest, and need of the community generating environmental data.¬†
