### **Support play for intermediary organizations: Create a guide detailing a variety of data governance frameworks and models depending on their desired outcome.**Â 
There is a plethora of writing on different [[Decoders/Data Governance Models\|data governance models]], published by and tailored to various audiences. However, none that weâ€™re aware of focus specifically on the audience of data stewards or organizations collecting and using community-generated environmental data. Their goals are contextually driven and markedly different from corporate or academic data governance, and as the case studies demonstrate, require unique solutions to unlock the potential benefit of data use and sharing.Â 

Intermediary organizations can create a user-friendly guide that links an organizationâ€™s definition and goals to specific data governance models. This guide can include start-up implementation processes for employing these models, pros and cons of each model, and use case scenarios. Additionally, this guide can provide information on how to document a framework that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into a predetermined governance model.



#### ðŸŒ± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source.

*Takeaway:* Because [[Decoders/Data Governance\|data governance]] can be understood and employed in many different ways, it is essential to define what data governance looks like within your project team. 
Data governance encompasses the decision making rules, processes, workflows, and tools that determine who owns, manages, shares, and uses the data and how, as well as where the data is stored and shared. Different aspects of data governance may be prioritized differently depending on data stewardsâ€™ varying needs. For example, metadata and findability may be paramount to one organization, whereas protection of sensitive data may be the highest priority for another.
