### **Support play for intermediary organizations: Create templates to support data sharing.**
Intermediary organizations can create customizable templates to support [[Decoders/Data Sharing\|data sharing]]. These could include templates for creating partnership protocols, [[Decoders/Data Sharing Agreements\|data sharing agreements]], and facilitating conversations on data sharing. 


> [!How-To Guide]
> OEDP created guidance for environmental data sharing, see our zine [[How-To Guides & Zines/Zine - The Data We Own\|Zine - The Data We Own]] to think critically and prepare for discussions about data sharing agreements.



#### ðŸŒ± Each play stems from a takeaway from an case study, workshop, or other learning source.

_Takeaway:_Â Data sharing agreements are contracts. They don't build relationships, but rather maintain existing relationships.
While [[Decoders/Data Sharing Agreements\|data sharing agreements]] are essential tools in #collaboration, they are only one aspect of a larger relationship or partnership. Especially with environmental data, there can be power asymmetries between the two data-sharing parties, such as community based organizations and university-affiliated researchers. These power asymmetries materialize as differing levels of #capacity, funding, access to legal resources, and incentives, which have disadvantaged smaller community-based organizations and led to data #misuse and extractive relationships. Power asymmetries donâ€™t necessarily stall a collaboration, but they should prompt the two parties to align on the central purpose and goals of the data sharing and use. In other words, they need to be able to build a strong working relationship before sharing.
