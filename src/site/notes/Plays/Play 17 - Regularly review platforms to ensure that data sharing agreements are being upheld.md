##### **Takeaway: Data sharing agreements are contracts. They don't build relationships, but rather maintain existing relationships.** 
While data sharing agreements are essential tools in collaboration, they are only one aspect of a larger relationship or partnership. Especially with environmental data, there can be power asymmetries between the two data-sharing parties, such as community based organizations and university-affiliated researchers. These power asymmetries materialize as differing levels of capacity, funding, access to legal resources, and incentives, which have disadvantaged smaller community-based organizations and led to data misuse and extractive relationships. Power asymmetries don’t necessarily stall a collaboration, but they should prompt the two parties to align on the central purpose and goals of the data sharing and use. In other words, they need to be able to build a strong working relationship before sharing.

##### **Technical play for data stewards: Regularly review platforms to ensure that data sharing agreements are being upheld.** 
Establish a systematic approach to reviewing platforms and ensuring compliance with data-sharing agreements. 
1. Schedule regular (e.g., quarterly or biannual) reviews of platforms and processes. 
2. Where possible, use monitoring tools to track data usage and access logs for suspicious activities.
3. Conduct audits to compare access privileges with data-sharing agreements.
4. Document findings and address any non-compliance. Communicate results with key individuals.
